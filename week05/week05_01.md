# CSS selectors and combinators

## `Type`, `Universal`, `Class` and `ID` selectors

### 1. Type Selectors

The _type selector_ selects all elements that have the given node name. For example, div will select all `<div>` elements and input will match any `<input>` element.

```
...
<body>
  <h1>Type Selectors</h1>

  <p>
    Eat it all. When in doubt, <span>pressure cook it</span>. Icing can be a bit of a hassle
    to make and dirties one more bowl. Caramelize. Caramelize. Comfort food. I beepity bop
    blanched the cauliflower. Let me tell you, it was jazzy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brown. Cooked to perfection. Toast them in a <strong>toaster</strong> oven or carefully
    in the <em>toaster</em>, just until they turn golden brown. Place piece of bread in
    toaster oven. Blanch the broccoli. Add anchovies. Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours
    at least to make sure it is <em>frozen</em>.
  </p>

span {
  background-color: yellow;
}

strong {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

em {
  color: orange;
}
```

### 2. Universal Selector

The _universal selector_ is indicated by an asterisk (`*`). It selects everything in the document. If `*` is chained using a **descendant combinator**, it selects everything inside that ancestor element. For example, `p *` selects all the nested elements in the `<p>` element.

```
...
<body>
  <h1>Universal Selector</h1>
  <p>
    Lorem <strong>ipsum</strong> dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam a posuere
    sapien. Cras gravida eleifend tortor, eget scelerisque dui suscipit cursus. In consequat
    arcu nec massa mattis, vel elementum <strong>dolor</strong> vulputate. Vivamus commodo
    laoreet sollicitudin. Donec <strong>varius</strong> purus eget sem eleifend, vel
    justo ullamcorper.
  </p>

    inceptos himenaeos. Donec orci metus, porta non <strong>tristique</strong> ac, egestas
    ac tellus. Donec convallis leo leo, ut lobortis diam sagittis sed.
  </p>
</body>
...
```

> week05\02_universal_selectors\style.css

```
* {
  margin: 0;
}

p *:first-child {
  margin: 10px;
}
```

### 3. Class Selector

The _class selector_ selects all elements that have the given class attribute denoted by the class name prefixed with a period (`.`). For example, `.index` will match any element that has `class="index"`.

> week05\03_class_selectors\index.html

```
...
<body>
  <h1>Class Selectors</h1>

  <div class="notebox">
    This is an informational note.
  </div>

  <div class="notebox warning">
    This note shows a warning.
  </div>

  <div class="notebox danger">
    This note shows danger!
  </div>

  <div class="danger">
    This won't get styled â€” it also needs to have the notebox class
  </div>
</body>
...
```

> week05\03_class_selectors\style.css

```
.notebox {
  border: 4px solid #666;
  padding: .5em;
}

.notebox.warning {
  border-color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.notebox.danger {
  border-color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### 4. ID Selector

The _ID selector_ selects an element based on the value of its id attribute. The selector is the id prefixed with a "number sign" (`#`). For example, `#toc` will match the element that has `id="toc"`

> week05\04_id_selectors\index.html

```
...
<body>
  <h1 id="heading">ID Selectors</h1>

  <p>
    Spread the jelly on the other side. Hail to the chef. Bake 18-22 minutes, or until crust
    is light golden <span id="heading">brown</span>. Spread the jelly on the other side.
    With baking, it is so important to make all of your measurements precise. All cooking is
    a matter of time. In general, the more time the better. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  </p>

  <p id="one">
    Blanche. You don't come into cooking to get rich. Beat ingredients until smooth and
    fluffy. Blanch the broccoli. Blend. Boom. Celery. Boom. Peanut butter. Boom. Raisins.
    Boom. It's ants on a log, son. Cinnamon toast.
  </p>
</body>
...
```

> week05\04_id_selectors\style.css

```
#one {
  background-color: yellow;
}

h1#heading {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```
