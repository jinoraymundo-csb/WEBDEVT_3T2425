# CSS selectors and combinators

## `Pseudo-classes` and `Pseudo-elements`

### 1. pseudo-class

A **pseudo-class** is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer. They tend to act as if you had applied a class to some part of your document, often helping you cut down on excess classes in your markup, and giving you more flexible, maintainable code.

Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon. For example, `:hover` is a pseudo-class.

```
...
<body>
  <article>
    <p class="first">
      Fry. We're all about flavor on this side. In a large mixing bowl, add the first 4
      ingredients. The greatest dishes are very simple. Will keep at room temperature in an
      airtight container for 3-4 days. Add bacon bits. Broil.
    </p>

    <p>
      Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. I beepity
      bop blanched the cauliflower. Let me tell you, it was jazzy. Blanch the broccoli. There
      will be enough to freeze for leftovers. Baste. But if you don't have a garden,
      store-bought is fine.
    </p>
  </article>
</body>

```
> week05\07_pseudoclass\style.css
```
article p:first-child {
  font-size: 120%;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### User-action pseudo classes

Some pseudo-classes only apply when the user interacts with the document in some way. These user-action pseudo-classes, sometimes referred to as **dynamic pseudo-classes**, act as if a class had been added to the element when the user interacts with it. Examples include:

- `:hover` this only applies if the user moves their pointer over an element, typically a link

- `:focus` only applies if the user focuses the element by clicking or using keyboard controls

```
...
<body>
  <p><a href="">Hover over me</a></p>
</body>
```

> week05\08_dynamicpseudoclass\style.css

```
a:link,
a:visited {
  color: rebeccapurple;
  font-weight: bold;
}

a:hover {
  color:hotpink;
}
```

### 2. pseudo-element

**Pseudo-elements** behave in a similar way. However, they act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.

Pseudo-elements start with a double colon `::`. `::before` is an example of a pseudo-element.

> week05\09_pseudoelement\index.html

```
...
<body>
  <article>
    <p>
      Hit that pan with a tablespoon of EVOO. Beat the eggs. Sprinkle the other 1/2 of
      cookie crumbs over top of the cake. Fry. Spread a generous dollop on each cupcake. The
      secret to using an ingredient is knowing when not to use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's money. If you think well, you cook well. Stir-fry in a piping-hot wok. Add wet
      ingredients into dry ingredients and whisk to combine. Place piece of bread in toaster
      oven. Cooking up a storm. Fry.
    </p>
  </article>
</body>
...
```

> week05\09_pseudoelement\style.css
```
article p::first-line {
  font-size: 120%;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

It acts as if a `<span>` was magically wrapped around that first formatted line, and updated each time the line length changed.

You can see that this selects the first line of both paragraphs.
