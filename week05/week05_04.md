# CSS selectors and combinators

## `Combinators`

Combinators combine other selectors in a way that gives them a useful relationship to each other and the location of content in the document.

### 1. Descendant Combinator

The **descendant combinator** — typically represented by a single space ("` `") character — combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.

`body article p`

> week05\10_combinators_descendant\index.html

```
...
<div class="box"><p>Text in .box</p></div>
<div class="box">Text in .box but not inside a paragraph element</div>
...
```

> week05\10_combinators_descendant\style.css

```
.box p {
  color: red;
}
```

### 2. Child Combinator

The child combinator (`>`) is placed between two CSS selectors. It matches only those elements matched by the second selector that are the **direct** children of elements matched by the first. Descendant elements further down the hierarchy don't match. For example, to select only `<p>` elements that are direct children of `<article>` elements:

`article > p`

> week05\11_combinators_child\index.html
```
<ul>
  <li>Halo-Halo</li>
  <li>Buchi
    <ol>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
      <li>Peanut</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
```

> week05\11_combinators_child\style.css
```
ul > li {
  border-top: 5px solid red;
}
```

The child combinator selects only those `<li>` elements which are direct children of a `<ul>`, and styles them with a top border.

If you remove the `>` that designates this as a **child combinator**, you end up with a **descendant selector** and all `<li>` elements will get a red border.

### 3. Next-sibling Combinator

The **next-sibling combinator** (`+`) is placed between two CSS selectors. It matches only those elements matched by the second selector that are t**he next sibling element** of the first selector. For example, to select all `<img>` elements that are immediately preceded by a `<p>` element:

`p + img`

> week05\12_combinators_next_sibling\index.html
```
<article>
  <h1>A heading</h1>
  <p>
    Bake 18-22 minutes, or until crust is light golden brown. There will be enough to freeze
    for leftovers. Blend. Sear 1 minute on each side. Kitchens are hard environments and
    they form incredibly strong characters. Hail to the chef. You don't come into cooking to
    get rich.
  </p>

  <p>
    Add bacon bits. Carefully tie the dough in a knot, creating a short piece on one end and
    a longer tail on the other end. Add bacon bits. Add sugar. Cooking requires dealing with
    failure and uncertainty in a creative way. Whisk. Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
  </p>

</article>
```

> week05\12_combinators_next_sibling\style.css

```
h1 + p {
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: .5em;
}
```

### 4. Subsequent-sibling Combinator

If you want to select siblings of an element even if they are not directly adjacent, then you can use the **subsequent-sibling combinator** (`~`). To select all `<img>` elements that come anywhere after `<p>` elements:

`p ~ img`

> week05\13_combinators_subsequent_sibling\index.html

```
<article>
  <h1>A heading</h1>
  <p>first sibling that is a paragraph</p>
  <div>I am a div</div>
  <p>Another sibling that is a paragraph.</p>
</article>
```

> week05\13_combinators_subsequent_sibling\style.css

```
h1 ~ p {
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: .5em;
}
```
