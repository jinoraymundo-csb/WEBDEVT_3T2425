# CSS selectors and combinators

## `Attribute` Selectors

### 1. Presence and value selectors

These selectors enable the selection of an element based on the presence of an attribute alone (for example `href`), or on various different matches against the value of the attribute.

| Selector | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[attr]` | `a[title]` | Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute |
| `[attr=value]` | `a[href="https://example.com"]` | Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute whose value is exactly _value_ â€” the string inside the quotes. |
| `[attr~=value]` | `p[class~="special"]` | Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute whose value is exactly _value_, or contains value in its (space separated) list of values. | 
| `[attr\|=value]` | `div[lang\|="zh"]` | Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute whose value is exactly _value_ or begins with value immediately followed by a hyphen. |

  <h1>Attribute presence and value selectors</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Onion</li>

```
li[class] {
  font-size: 200%;
}

li[class="a"] {
  background-color: yellow;
}

li[class~="a"] {
  color: red;
}
```

In this example, you can see these selectors in action:
- By using `li[class]` we can match any list item with a **class attribute**. This matches all of the list items except the first one.
- `li[class="a"]` matches a selector with a class of `a`, but not a selector with a class of `a` with another space-separated class as part of the value. It selects the second list item.
- `li[class~="a"]` will match a class of `a` but also a value that contains the class of `a` as part of a whitespace-separated list. It selects the second and third list items.

### 2. Substring matching selectors

These selectors allow for more advanced matching of substrings inside the value of your attribute. For example, if you had classes of box-warning and box-error and wanted to match everything that started with the string "box-", you could use `[class^="box-"]` to select them both (or `[class|="box"]`)

| Selector | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[attr^="value"]` | `li[class^="box-"]` | Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute, whose value **begins** with _value_ |
| `[attr$="value"]` | `li[class$="-box"]` | Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute whose value **ends** with _value_ |
| `[attr*="value"]` | `li[class*="box"]` | Matches elements with an _attr_ attribute whose value **contains** _value_ **anywhere within** the string.

```
...
<body>
  <h1>Attribute substring matching selectors</h1>
  <ul>
    <li class="a">Chicken and Pork Adobo</li>
    <li class="ab">Gising-Gising</li>
    <li class="bca">Sweet and Sour Fish Fillet</li>
    <li class="bcabc">Sizzling Sisig</li>
  </ul>
</body>
...
```

> week05\06_attribute_selectors_substring\style.css

```
li[class^="a"] {
  font-size: 200%;
}

li[class$="a"] {
  background-color: yellow;
}

li[class*="a"] {
  color: red;
}
```

- `li[class^="a"]` matches any attribute value which starts with `a`, so matches the first two list items.
- `li[class$="a"]` matches any attribute value that ends with `a`, so matches the first and third list item.
- `li[class*="a"]` matches any attribute value where `a` appears anywhere in the string, so it matches all of our list items.
