# JavaScript Objects

JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An **object** is merely a collection of **properties**, 
and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a **function**, in
which case, the property is known as a **method**.

Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. In JavaScript, 
an object is a standalone entity, with **properties** and **type**. Compare it with a car, for example. A car is an object, 
with properties. A car has a color, a make, model, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have 
properties, which define their characteristics.

## 01. Creating new objects

You can create an object with an **object initializer**. Alternatively, you can first create a constructor function and
then an "instantiate" an object by invoking that function with the `new` operator.

### 01A. Using object initalizers

Also called as **object literals**.

```
const obj = {
  property1: "value1",  // property name may me an identifier
  2: "value2",          // or a number
  "property n": "value3",  // or a string
}
```

```
const nickiMirage = {
  make: "Mitsubishi",
  model: "Mirage",
  engine: {
    cylinders: 4,
    size: 1.5,
  }
}

const oliviaRodwigo = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Wigo",
  transmission: "automatic",
}
```

### 01B. Using a constructor function

Alternatively, you can create an object using a constructor:
1. Define the object type by writing a constructor function
2. Create an instance of the object with `new`

```
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

const martin = new Car("Nissan", "Navara", 2020);
const sotto = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2018);
const deBelen = new Car("Geely", "CoolRay", 2023);
```

### 01C. Using `Object.create()` via prototypes

```
const Song = {
  type: "pop",
  displayType() {
    // Method which will display type of Song
    console.log(this.type);
  },
};

const hitMeBabyOneMoreTime = Object.create(Song);
hitMeBabyOneMoreTime.displayType(); // Logs: pop

// Create new song with type called "rock"
const cherryWaves = Object.create(Song);
cherryWaves.type = "rock";
cherryWaves.displayType(); // Logs: rock
```

## 02: Objects and properties

A JavaScript object has properties associated to it. Object properties are basically the same as variables, except that
they are associated with objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.

### 02A. Accessing properties

You may access an object property by its name. Property accessors come in two syntaxes A) **dot notation** and B) **bracket notation

> dot notation
```
const myCar = {};
const myBike = {};

// dot notation
myCar.make = "Chevrolet";
myCar.model = "Suburban";
myCar.year = 2024;

// bracket notation
myBike["make"] = "Bristol";
myBike["model"] = "Veloce";
myBike["year"] = 2018;
```

> practical usage of bracket notation is when a property name contains spaces (" ") and hyphens ("-")

Nonexistent properties of an object have a value of `undefined`

```
myBike.wiperCount;  // undefined
```


### 02B. Enumerating properties

There are thhree native ways to list / traverse object properties:

- `for...in` loops. This method traverses all of the enumerable string properties of an object as well as its prototype chain
- `Object.keys()`. This method returns an `array` with only the enumerable string property names
- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`. This method returns an array containing all the own string property names

```
const house = {
  rooms: 3,
  toilets: 3,
  hasGarage: true,
}
```

> `for...in`

```
function showProps(obj, objName) {
  let result = "";
  for (const i in obj) {
    if (Object.hasOwn(obj, i)) {
      result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}\n`;
    }
  }
  console.log(result);
}
```

> `Object.keys()`

```
function showProps(obj, objName) {
  let result = "";
  Object.keys(obj).forEach((i) => {
    result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}\n`;
  });
  console.log(result);
}
```

> `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`

```
function listAllProperties(myObj) {
  let objectToInspect = myObj;
  let result = [];

  while (objectToInspect !== null) {
    result = result.concat(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(objectToInspect));
    objectToInspect = Object.getOwnPrototypeOf(objectToInspect);
  }

  return result;
}
```

### 02C. Deleting properties

You may remove non-inherited properties using the `delete` operator

```
const myObj = new Object();
myObj.a = 5;
myObj.b = 12;

delete myObj.a;
console.log("a" in myObj);  // false
```
