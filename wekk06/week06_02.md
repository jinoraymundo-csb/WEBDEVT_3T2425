# CSS Layouts

CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they're positioned relative to the following factors: 
1. their default position in normal layout flow
2. the other elements around them
3. their parent container, 
4. the main viewport/window.

## 1. Normal Flow

Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout. Let's look at a quick HTML example:

```
<p>Seasons in Stardew Valley</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spring</li>
  <li>Summer</li>
  <li>Fall</li>
  <li>Winter</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you, ConcernedApe!</p>
```

By default, the browser will display this code as follows:


![Normal Flow](images/01.png)

Note how the HTML is displayed in the exact order in which it appears in the source code, with elements stacked on top of one another — the first paragraph, followed by the unordered list, followed by the second paragraph.

The elements that appear one below the other are described as **block** elements, in contrast to **inline** elements, which appear beside one another like the individual words in a paragraph.

For many of the elements on your page, the normal flow will create exactly the layout you need. However, for more complex layouts you will need to alter this default behavior using some of the tools available to you in CSS. Starting with a well-structured HTML document is very important because you can then work with the way things are laid out by default rather than fighting against it.

<details>

<summary>Text Direction</summary>

> [!NOTE]
> The direction in which block element contents are laid out is described as the Block Direction. The Block Direction runs vertically in a language such as English, which has a horizontal writing mode. It would run horizontally in any language with a Vertical Writing Mode, such as Japanese. The corresponding Inline Direction is the direction in which inline contents (such as a sentence) would run.

</details>

The `display` property
> Standard values such as block, inline or inline-block can change how elements behave in normal flow, for example, by making a block-level element behave like an inline-level element. We also have entire layout methods that are enabled via specific display values, for example, CSS grid and Flexbox, which alter how child elements are laid out inside their parents.

Floats
> Applying a `float` value such as `left` can cause block-level elements to wrap along one side of an element, like the way images sometimes have text floating around them in magazine layouts.

The `position` property
> Allows you to precisely control the placement of boxes inside other boxes. static positioning is the default in normal flow, but you can cause elements to be laid out differently using other values, for example, as fixed to the top of the browser viewport.

Table layout
> Features designed for styling parts of an HTML table can be used on non-table elements using `display: table` and associated properties.

Multi-column layout
> The Multi-column layout properties can cause the content of a block to lay out in columns, as you might see in a newspaper.

## 2. The `display` property

The main methods for achieving page layout in CSS all involve specifying values for the `display` property. This property allows us to change the default way something displays. Everything in normal flow has a default value for display; i.e., a default way that elements are set to behave. For example, the fact that paragraphs in English display one below the other is because they are styled with display: block. If you create a link around some text inside a paragraph, that link remains inline with the rest of the text, and doesn't break onto a new line. This is because the `<a>`element is `display: inline` by default.

## 3. Flexbox

**Flexbox** is the short name for the **Flexible Box Layout CSS module**, designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in one dimension — either as a row or as a column. To use flexbox, you apply `display: flex` to the **parent element** of the elements you want to lay out; all its direct children then become flex items.

> week06\04_flexbox\index.html

```
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box1">Spring</div>
  <div class="box2">Summer</div>
  <div class="box3">Fall</div>
  <div class="box4">Winter</div>
</div>
```

> week06\04_flexbox\style.css

```
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

### Setting the `flex` property

In addition to properties that can be applied to a flex container, there are also properties that can be applied to flex items. These properties, among other things, can change the way that items flex, enabling them to expand or contract according to available space.

As a simple example, we can add the `flex` property to all of our child items, and give it a value of 1. This will cause all of the items to grow and fill the container, rather than leaving space at the end. If there is more space then the items will become wider; if there is less space they will become narrower. In addition, if you add another element to the markup, the other items will all become smaller to make space for it; the items all together continue taking up all the space.

> week06\04_flexbox\style.css
```
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 1px solid black;
  flex: 1;
}
```

## 4. Grid Layout

While flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, **Grid Layout** is designed for two dimensions — lining things up in rows and columns.

### Setting `display: grid;`

Similar to flexbox, we enable grid layout with its specific display value — `display: grid`. The below example uses similar markup to the flex example, with a container and some child elements. In addition to using `display: grid`, we also define some row and column tracks for the parent using the `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties respectively. We've defined three columns, each of 1fr, as well as two rows of 100px. We don't need to put any rules on the child elements; they're automatically placed into the cells our grid's created.

> week06\05_grid\index.html

```
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box1">Asia</div>
  <div class="box2">North America</div>
  <div class="box3">South America</div>
  <div class="box4">Africa</div>
  <div class="box5">Europe</div>
  <div class="box6">Antartica</div>
  <div class="box7">Oceania</div>
</div>
```

> week06\05_grid\style.css

```
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
  gap: 10px;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

### Placing items on a grid

Once you have a grid, you can explicitly place your items on it, rather than relying on the auto-placement behavior. In the next example below, we've defined the same grid, but this time with three child items. We've set the start and end line of each item using the `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties. This causes the items to span multiple tracks.

> week06\06_grid_manual\index.html

```
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box1">Asia</div>
  <div class="box2">North America</div>
  <div class="box3">South America</div>
</div>
```

> week06\06_grid_manual\style.css

```
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
  gap: 10px;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.box1 {
  grid-column: 2 / 4;
  grid-row: 1;
}

.box2 {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

.box3 {
  grid-row: 2;
  grid-column: 3;
}
```

## 5. Floats

Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the block level elements that follow it in normal flow. The floated element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content _floats_ around it.

The `float` property has four possible values:

- `left` — Floats the element to the left.
- `right` — Floats the element to the right.
- `none` — Specifies no floating at all. This is the default value.
- `inherit` — Specifies that the value of the float property should be inherited from the element's parent element.

> week06\07_float\index.html

```
<h1>Modest Mouse</h1>

<div class="box">Float on</div>

<p>
  I backed my car into a cop car the other day
  Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
  I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
  Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
</p>
```

> week06\07_float\style.css

```
.box {
  background-color: rgb(207 232 220);
  border: 2px solid rgb(79 185 227);
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;

  float: left;
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  margin-right: 30px;
}
```

## 6. Positioning Techniques

Positioning allows you to move an element from where it would otherwise be placed in normal flow over to another location. Positioning isn't a method for creating the main layouts of a page; it's more about managing and fine-tuning the position of specific items on a page.

- **Static Positioning** is the default that every element gets. It just means "put the element into its normal position in the document layout flow

- **Relative Positioning** allows you to modify an element's position on the page, moving it relative to its position in normal flow, as well as making it overlap other elements on the page. 

- **Absolute Positioning** moves an element completely out of the page's normal layout flow, like it's sitting on its own separate layer. From there, you can fix it to a position relative to the edges of its closest positioned ancestor

- **Fixed Positioning** is very similar to absolute positioning except that it fixes an element relative to the browser viewport, not another element. This is useful for creating effects such as a persistent navigation menu that always stays in the same place on the screen as the rest of the content scrolls.

- **Sticky Positioning** makes an element act like `position: relative` until it hits a defined offset from the viewport, at which point it acts like `position: fixed`.

> week06\08_positioning_base\index.html

```
<h1>Positioning</h1>

<p>I am a basic block level element.</p>
<p class="positioned">I am a basic block level element.</p>
<p>I am a basic block level element.</p>
```

> week06\08_positioning_base\style.css

```
body {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

p {
  background-color: rgb(207 232 220);
  border: 2px solid rgb(79 185 227);
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

.positioned {
  background: rgb(255 84 104 / 30%);
  border: 2px solid rgb(255 84 104);
}
```

### Relative positioning

Relative positioning allows you to offset an item from its default position in normal flow. This means you could achieve a task such as moving an icon down a bit so it lines up with a text label. 

> week06\09_positioning_relative\index.html

_same as 08_positioning_base\index.html_

> week06\09_positioning_relative\style.css

_same as 08_positioning_base\style.css_ then add this:

```
.positioned {
  position: relative;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
}
```

### Absolute positioning

Absolute positioning is used to completely remove an element from the normal flow and instead position it using offsets from the edges of a containing block.

> week06\10_positioning_absolute\index.html

_same as 08_positioning_base\index.html_

> week06\10_positioning_absolute\style.css

_same as 08_positioning_base\style.css_ then add this:

```
.positioned {
  position: absolute;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
}
```

### Fixed positioning

Fixed positioning removes our element from document flow in the same way as absolute positioning. However, instead of the offsets being applied from the container, they are applied from the viewport.

> week06\11_positioning_fixed\index.html

```
<h1>Fixed positioning</h1>

<div class="positioned">Fixed</div>

<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla luctus aliquam
  dolor, eu lacinia lorem placerat vulputate. Duis felis orci, pulvinar id metus
  ut, rutrum luctus orci.
</p>

<p>
  Cras porttitor imperdiet nunc, at ultricies tellus laoreet sit amet. Sed
  auctor cursus massa at porta. Integer ligula ipsum, tristique sit amet orci
  vel, viverra egestas ligula. Curabitur vehicula tellus neque, ac ornare ex
  malesuada et.
</p>

<p>
  In vitae convallis lacus. Aliquam erat volutpat. Suspendisse ac imperdiet
  turpis. Aenean finibus sollicitudin eros pharetra congue. Duis ornare egestas
  augue ut luctus. Proin blandit quam nec lacus varius commodo et a urna. Ut id
  ornare felis, eget fermentum sapien.
</p>
```

> week06\11_positioning_fixed\style.css

_same as 08_positioning_base\style.css_ then add this:

```
.positioned {
  position: fixed;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
}
```

### Sticky Positioning

Sticky positioning mixes relative positioning with fixed positioning. When an item has `position: sticky`, it'll scroll in normal flow until it hits offsets from the viewport that we have defined. At that point, it becomes "stuck" as if it had `position: fixed` applied.

> week06\12_positioning_sticky\index.html

_same as 11_positioning_fixed\index.html_

> week06\12_positioning_fixed\style.css

_same as 08_positioning_base\style.css_ then add this:

```
.positioned {
  position: sticky;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
}
```

## 7. Multi-column layout

The multi-column layout CSS module provides us a way to lay out content in columns, similar to how text flows in a newspaper. While reading up and down columns is less useful in a web context due to the users having to scroll up and down, arranging content into columns can, nevertheless, be a useful technique.

To turn a block into a multi-column container, we use either the `column-count` property, which tells the browser how many columns we would like to have, or the `column-width` property, which tells the browser to fill the container with as many columns as possible of a specified width.

> week06\13_multicolumn\index.html

```
<div class="container">
  <h1>Multi-column Layout</h1>

  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla luctus
    aliquam dolor, eu lacinia lorem placerat vulputate. Duis felis orci,
    pulvinar id metus ut, rutrum luctus orci. Cras porttitor imperdiet nunc, at
    ultricies tellus laoreet sit amet. Sed auctor cursus massa at porta.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nam vulputate diam nec tempor bibendum. Donec luctus augue eget malesuada
    ultrices. Phasellus turpis est, posuere sit amet dapibus ut, facilisis sed
    est. Nam id risus quis ante semper consectetur eget aliquam lorem.
  </p>

  <p>
    Vivamus tristique elit dolor, sed pretium metus suscipit vel. Mauris
    ultricies lectus sed lobortis finibus. Vivamus eu urna eget velit cursus
    viverra quis vestibulum sem. Aliquam tincidunt eget purus in interdum. Cum
    sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus
    mus.
  </p>
</div>
```

> week06\13_multicolumn\style.css

```
.container {
  column-width: 200px;
}
```
