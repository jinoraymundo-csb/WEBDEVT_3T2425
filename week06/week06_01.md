# The box model

Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.

---

## Block and inline boxes

In CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the categories of `block` boxes and `inline` boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an **inner display type** and an **outer display type**.

---

## Outer display type

If a box has an outer display type of `block`, then:

- The box will break onto a new line
- The `width` and `height` properties are respected
- **Padding**, **margin**, and **border** will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
- If `width` is not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases, the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available

Some HTML elements such as `<h1>`, and `<p>`, use `block` as their outer display type by default.

If a box has an outer display type of `inline`, then:

- The box will not break onto a new line
- The `width` and `height` properties will not apply
- **Top** and **bottom** padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
- **Left** and **right** padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box

Some HTML elements such as `<a>`, `<span>`, `<em>` and `<strong>` use `inline` as their outer display type by default

---

## Inner display type

Boxes also have an inner display type, which dictates how elements inside that box are laid out.

### Examples of different display types

> week06\01_block_display\index.html

```
<p>Spring Crops</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parsnip</li>
  <li>Potato</li>
  <li>Green Bean</li>
  <li>Cauliflower</li>
  <li>Rhubarb</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are the crops that grow only in Spring. With the exception of
  <span class="block">Green Bean</span>, all crops can be
  <span>harvested once only</span>.
</p>
```

> week06\01_block_display\style.css

```
p,
ul {
  border: 2px solid rebeccapurple;
  padding: .5em;
}

.block,
li {
  border: 2px solid blue;
  padding: .5em;
}

ul {
  display: flex;
  list-style: none;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}
```

> The example above has three different HTML elements, all of which have an outer display type of `block`

- A paragraph with a border added in CSS. The browser renders this as a block box. The paragraph starts on a new line and extends the entire available width

- A list which is laid out using `display: flex`. This establishes flex layout for the children of the container, which are flex items. The list itself is a block box (like the paragraph), expands to the full container width and breaks onto a new line.

- A block-level paragraph, inside are two `<span>` elements. These elements would normally be `inline`, however, one of the elements has a class of "block" which gets set to `display: block`.

> week06\02_inline_display\index.html

```
<p>
  In summer, Some of the
  <span>highest-profit-yielding crops</span> can be grown
  like the <span>Starfruit</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blueberry</li>
  <li>Yam</li>
  <li>Bok Choy</li>
  <li>Melon</li>
</ul>
<p class="inline">A regular Starfruit is sold at 750g</p>
<p class="inline">A gold quality Starfruit is sold at 1,125g</p>
```

> week06\02_inline_display\style.css

```
p,
ul {
  border: 2px solid rebeccapurple;
}

span,
li {
  border: 2px solid blue;
}

ul {
  display: inline-flex;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}
```

> In this example, we see how `inline` elements behave

- The `<span>` elements in the first paragraph are inline by default and so do not force line breaks.

- The `<ul>` element that is set to `display: inline-flex` creates an inline box containing some flex items.

- The two paragraphs are both set to `display: inline`. The inline flex container and paragraphs all run together on one line rather than breaking onto new lines (as they would do if they were displaying as block-level elements).

> [!NOTE]
> The key thing to remember for now is: Changing the value of the `display` property can change whether the outer display type of a box is **block** or **inline**. This changes the way it displays alongside other elements in the layout.

## The CSS Box Model

The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — **margin**, **border**, **padding**, and **content** — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. Inline boxes use just _some_ of the behavior defined in the box model.

> [!WARNING]
> To add complexity, there is a _standard_ and an _alternate_ box model. By default, browsers use the standard box model.

### Parts of a box

Making up a block box in CSS we have the:

- **Content box** - the area where you content is displayed; size it using properties like `inline-size`, and `block-size` or `width` and `height`.

- **Padding box** - the padding sits around the content as white space; size it using `padding` and related properties

- **Border box** - the border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using `border` and related properties

- **Margin box** - the margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using `margin` and related properties

![Parts of a Box](images/02.png)

## The Standard CSS box model

In the standard box model, if you set `inline-size` and `block-size` (or `width` and `height`) property values on a box, these values define the `inline-size` and `block-size` (`width` and `height` in horizontal languages) of the **content box**. Any padding and borders are then added to those dimensions to get the total size taken up by the box.

```
.box {
  width: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

![Standard CSS Box Model](images/03.png)

> The actual space taken up by the box will be 410px wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and 210px high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box — sure, it affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but only the space outside the box. The box's area stops at the border — it does not extend into the margin.

## The Alternative CSS box model

In the alternative box model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page. The content area width is that width minus the width for the padding and border. No need to add up the border and padding to get the real size of the box.

To turn on the alternative model for an element, set `box-sizing: border-box` on it:

```
.box {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

```
.box {
  width: 350px;
  inline-size: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  block-size: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

Now, the actual space taken up by the box will be 350px in the inline direction and 150px in the block direction.

![Alternative CSS Box Model](images/04.png)

To use the alternative box model for all of your elements (which is a common choice among developers), set the box-sizing property on the `<html>` element and set all other elements to inherit that value:

```
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

## Playing with the box model

In the example below, you can see two boxes. Both have a class of `.box`, which gives them the same `width`, `height`, `margin`, `border`, and `padding`. The only difference is that the second box has been set to use the **alternative box model**.

> week06\03_playing_boxes\index.html

```
<div class="box">I use the standard box model.</div>
<div class="box alternate">I use the alternate box model.</div>
```

> week06\03_playing_boxes\style.css

```
.box {
  border: 5px solid rebeccapurple;
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 40px;
  margin: 40px;
  width: 300px;
  height: 150px;
}

.alternate {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Can you change the size of the second box (by adding CSS to the `.alternate` class) to make it match the first box in width and height?
