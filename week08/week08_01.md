# JavaScript Basics

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to a web page.
This can be in the form of "event handlers" that respond to an event,
input validations that should happen before form data is sent to a server for processing, 
and many more. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

- Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream for a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.

- Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Facebook.

- Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

```
<h1>This will be changed</h1>
<div id="myFavoriteThing"></div>
<ul>
  <li>Spring</li>
  <li>Summer</li>
  <li>Fall</li>
  <li>Winter</li>
</ul>
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

```
const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
myHeading.textContent = "Hello WEBDEVT world!";

const favoriteThingContainer = document.querySelector("#myFavoriteThing");
favoriteThingContainer.className = "consumable";
favoriteThingContainer.textContent = "Satisfying Cravings";

const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");
listItems.forEach((item, index) => {
  item.className = `itemNumber${index + 1}`;
});
```

> The Browser API exposes an object named `document` which represents everything inside a web page.

## What just happened?

1. The `<h1>` initially has a text content "This will be changed"
    - we assigned the HTML element to a JavaScript object variable named "myHeading" using the `const` keyword
    - we can then manipulate its properties by directly assigning it to a different value

2. The `<div>` initially did not have any class or text content assigned to it.
    - we directly assigned a **class** to this HTML element by using the same technique as above
    - we also set a text content via this method

3. The 4 `<li>` were **all** selected via the `querySelectorAll()` function from the `document` object
    - we used a `forEach()` loop (more to that later) to iterate all items and dynamically assign a class name for all list items

## Variables

Variables are "containers" that hold / store values. In modern JavaScript, you either use the `const` or `let` keyword to declare a variable

```
let weatherToday = "sunny";
let odometerSteps = 10_000;
const PI = 3.1415926;
const waterBoilingPointInC = "100";
```

A few notes:

- You can name variables whatever you want, as long as it complies with a set of [rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables)
- variables declared with the `let` keyword can be modified later
- variables declared with the `const` keyword cannot be modified once they are given an initial value

### Data Types

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String | This is a sequence of text, denoted by enclosing `'` or `"` quotation marks | `let name = "Jino";` |
| Number | Numerical value that is not enclosed by quotes | `let stepsTaken = 200;` |
| Boolean | `true` or `false`, also not enclosed by quotes | `let absent = false;` |
| Array | A variable that may contain a series or sequence of values | `let subjects = ["WEBDEVT", "SYSANDE"];` |
| Object | A complex value, like an HTML element | `let nameContainer = document.querySelector("#name");` |

---

## Comments

Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser interpreter ignores text marked as comments

```
/*
  Anything inside is not interpreted, always ignored.
*/
```

or a single line comment:

```
// This function parses the properties name and age from the given person object
```

---

## Operators

An **operator** is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two operands|values.

| Operator | Description | Symbol | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Addition | Adds two numbers to produce a sum | `+` | `const sum = 7 + 3;` |
| Concatenation | Combines a string with another value | `+` | `let name = "Jino" + " " + "Raymundo";` |
| Subtraction | Subtracts subtrahend(s) from a minuend to produce a difference | `-` | `const difference = 100 - 20;` |
| Multiplication | Multiplies a multiplicand with a multiplier(s) to produce a product | `*` | `const product = 5 * 10;` |
| Division | Divides a dividend with a divisor to produce a quotient | `/` | `const quotient = 6 / 3;` |
| Modulo | Divides a dividend with a divisor and yields the remainder | `%` | `const modulo = 5 % 3;` |
| Assignment | Assigns a value to a variable | `=` | `let a = 5;` |
| Equality | Returns a boolean value if two operands are of the same value | `==` | `if (a == x)` |
| Strict Equality | Returns a boolean value if two operands are of the same value and data type | `===` | `if (a === x)` |
| Not | Negates or returns the logical opposite value of what it precedes | `!` | `let a = true; !a;` |

---

## Conditionals

Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns `true` or `false`

```
let season = "winter";

if (season === "winter") {
  alert("Summer crops will wither in winter...");
} else {
  alert("Summer crops will grow in this season.");
}
```

---

## Functions

Functions are a way of packaging functionality that is intended to be reused at some point. This potentially avoids unnecessary code duplication. It is worth noting that a function **may** or **may not** return a value.

> function that returns a value

```
function multiply(num1, num2) {
  let result = num1 * num2;
  return result;
}

multiply(4, 6);
multiply(3, 12);
multiply(7, 8);
```

> function that does not return a value

```
function multiply(num1, num2) {
  let result = num1 * num2;
  console.log(result);
}

multiply(4, 6);
multiply(3, 12);
multiply(7, 8);
```

---

## Events

Interactivity in web pages is done via event handlers. These components "listens" for events happening within the context of a browser. 

```
document.querySelector("html").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("You have clicked within the viewport");
});
```
