# JavaScript Basics - Manipulating documents

When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things to do is to somehow change the structure and appearance of a web page.
It could be in the form of adding new `<li>` to a to-do list, changing the text content whenever an item is updated, etc.

![DOM Tree](images/01.png)

- **Root node**: The top node in the tree, which in the case of HTML is always the HTML node.
- **Child node**: A node directly inside another node. For example, IMG is a child of SECTION in the above example.
- **Descendant node**: A node anywhere inside another node. For example, IMG is a child of SECTION in the above example, and it is also a descendant. IMG is not a child of BODY, as it is two levels below it in the tree, but it is a descendant of BODY.
- **Parent node**: A node which has another node inside it. For example, BODY is the parent node of SECTION in the above example.
- **Sibling nodes**: Nodes that sit on the same level in the DOM tree. For example, IMG and P are siblings in the above example.
